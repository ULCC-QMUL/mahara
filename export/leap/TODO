TODOs for export LEAP plugin
============================

* Granular export: Check that we respect $this->views and $this->artefacts correctly
* Resume dates on export - can't export them as leap:dates, it has to be in the content, yet we have to import them again properly too
* Export views properly!
 - flag artefacts in the export properly that aren't otherwise surrounded by <a> or similar (e.g. blogs)
 - rewrite links to views when the views are part of the export
 - export special attributes on blocktypes to help us detect them on the way in (do this in combination with advanced import)
 - what about smilies?
* Documentation
 - developer
 - end-user
