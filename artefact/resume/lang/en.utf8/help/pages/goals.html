<h3>My Goals</h3>
<p>The goals area is divided into three sections: Personal, Academic and Career. Goals added here may be included in your views.</p>
<p>Personal or career goals are often provided in résumés so that employers can understand how a particular role might suit your ambitions.</p>
<p>You can also use the academic goals section to describe achievements you are seeking in your programme of study.</p>
