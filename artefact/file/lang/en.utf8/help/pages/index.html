<h3>Files</h3>
<p>Your files area is a repository for folders and files to use within your portfolio.</p>
<p>The number of files you may upload into your files area is dependant on your file storage limit which is displayed in the quota box on the right of the screen.</p>
<p>You can select several files at once for upload in the file dialogue box.</p>
<p>You can use drag and drop to organise your files and folders. Click on the folder or file icons and drag and drop them to the new location.</p>
<p>For security reasons your Site Administrator may restrict some file types from being uploaded. </p>
