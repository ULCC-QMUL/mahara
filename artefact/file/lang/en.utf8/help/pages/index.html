<h3>My Files</h3>
<p>Your Files  area is a repository for Folders and Files to use within your portfolio.
<p>The number  of Files you may upload into your Files area is dependant on your set file storage  limit which is displayed in the Quota box on the right of the screen. </p>
<p>For  security reasons your Site Administrator may restrict some file types  from being uploaded to the system. </p>
<p>You can use drag and drop to organise your files and folders.</p>
