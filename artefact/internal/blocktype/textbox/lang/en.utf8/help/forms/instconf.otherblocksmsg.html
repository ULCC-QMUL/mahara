<h3>Reusable textbox content</h3>
<p>It is possible to include the same textbox content in several
blocks, and these blocks can appear on different pages.  Updating the
text in one block will also change it in all other pages in which it
appears.  You can see a list of all the pages on which a particular
note is contained in your Notes area under the Content menu.</p>
<p>When you are editing a group or institution page, remember that
other group or institution members may have inserted this text inside
their own pages.  If you edit it here, it will be updated on their
pages too.</p>
