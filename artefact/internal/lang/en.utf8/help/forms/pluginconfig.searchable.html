<h3>Searchable fields</h3>

<p>Profile fields marked as Searchable will be available for all
logged in users to search on.</p>

<p>First name, last name and display name are generally always
searchable, however the exact behaviour of name searches is controlled
by the settings on the Site Options page for "Users can hide real
names" and "Search Usernames", as well as individual user
preferences.</p>

<p>Other searchable profile fields listed here such as email address
can be used to find users in a search query, but they are not
displayed in search resuts.</p>
