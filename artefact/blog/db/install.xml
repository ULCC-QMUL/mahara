    <!-- This table keeps track of files that are to be associated with a blog
    post, but for which the post has not yet been created, or the association
    has not yet been confirmed.  No file should ever be in both this table and
    artefact_blog_blogpost_file.

    This table only keeps track of files that are specifically uploaded for a
    blog post, not ones that have been uploaded already some other way, that
    the user wants to associate with a blog post. 

    Hopefully this table is unnecessary; we just store all temporary
    stuff in the javascript.
