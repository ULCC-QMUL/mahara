<p>A web log  or Blog is journal-like tool that allows you to record your thoughts and  experiences.&nbsp; You can allow other users  to post comments on your Blog allowing you to create a dialogue with your  readers.</p>
<p>While a  Blog itself is considered an Artefact, so are any individual Blog postings you  create.&nbsp; This means both Blogs and Blog  posts may be added to a View.</p>
Your Blogs area lists of all of your current Blogs.&nbsp; Click on the name of a Blog to add a new  posting or edit the Blog settings.&nbsp; To  create a new Blog select Add Blog.
