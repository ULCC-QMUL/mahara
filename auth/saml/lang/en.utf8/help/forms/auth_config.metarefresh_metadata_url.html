<h3>Metadata Refresh URL</h3>
<p>If a valid URL is provided in this field the SAML plugin will automatically download the latest metadata and store it locally, this removes the need to manually update the metadata when it changes on your Identity Provider. Note that the data fetched from this URL will take precedence over the XML metadata and replace it</p>
