<h3>Sync groups in these contexts only</h3>
<p>List of contexts where groups are located. Separate different
contexts with ';'. (e.g., 'ou=groups,o=org;ou=other,o=org').</p>
<p>If this field is left empty, the group sync cron will fall
back to using the same list of contexts as the "Contexts" setting
for where users are located.</p>
