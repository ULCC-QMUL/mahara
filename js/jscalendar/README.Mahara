Website: http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/old/
Version: 1.0

This calendar is used by Pieforms' calendar element.

Note: this is the last version released under the LGPL and it is no longer
maintained upstream.

Changes:

 * Slovenian language file that ships with jscalendar removed (calendar-si.js),
 * and new calendar-sl.js put in place, provided thanks to Gregor Anzelj
