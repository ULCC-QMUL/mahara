<h3>License icon</h3>
<p>This can be a http://... or https://... URL to an image elsewhere on your site or externally.</p>
<p>It can also be a license:... URL to specify license icons from the Mahara theme. For example, the
URL <pre>license:gfdl.png</pre> would refer to the file
<pre>static/images/license/gfdl.png</pre> in the theme.</p>
