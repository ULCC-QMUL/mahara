<h3>SMTP Encryption</h3>
<p>If the SMTP server supports encryption, enable it here.</p>
<p>When encryption is enabled the default ports are 465 for SSL and 587 for TLS. If your settings are different from default make sure that the port setting is correct. Check correct settings with your mail service provider.</p>
<p>This field may be disabled if overridden by a setting in your config.php file.</p>
