<h4>Edit Page Information</h4>

    and your Name Display preference for your page.

<h4>Edit View</h4>

    you to add to, or modify the display of the Artefacts associated with your
    page.

<h4>Submit for Assessment</h4>
<p>
    If you are preparing a Page as part of an assessed task  and you have been
    added as a member of a Controlled Membership Community that has an assigned
    Tutor, you will be able to Submit your page for assessment.
</p>
<p>
    Submit Page will lock the entire page and all associated Artefacts from
    editing and provide a ‘snapshot’ of your page on a certain date, and send
    it to your Tutor.  Note that any users with access to that page will still
    be able to place Feedback and Comments while it is locked for submission.
    Once the assessment process has been completed your tutor will release your
    page so that you may resume editing. You will be notified via Notifications
    when your page has been released from submission.
