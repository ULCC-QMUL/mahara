<h3>Collection Access</h3>
<p>Access for the collection is determined by the master view.</p>
<p>Initially the view at the top of the list will be set as the master view. You can change this here and apply the permissions to every other view in the collection at the same time by clicking 'Save & Apply'.</p>
<p> Please note that \'secret URL\' access types can not be used as access overrride.</p>
