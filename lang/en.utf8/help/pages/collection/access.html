<h3>Collection Access</h3>
<p>Access for the collection is determined by the master view.  Initially collections will have no override for view access unless explicitly set. <br /> This means that each view can have independent access permissions.<br /> Please note that \'secret URL\' access types can not be used as access overrride.</p>
