<h3>Collection Views</h3>
<p>Here you can add views to your collection and set the order in which they will display in view navigation blocktypes.</p>
<p>Initially the first view added will be set as the master view. You can change this at the next page - Access - and apply the permissions to every other view in the collection at the same time.</p>
