<h3><strong>Registration</strong></h3>
<p>  If an ePortfolio  account will not be created on your behalf by an institution associated with  this site, you will need to complete the Registration process. </p>
<p>Once you  have submitted the registration form an email will immediately be sent to your  email address.&nbsp; This email will contain a  link which once followed will confirm your account and log you into the system.&nbsp; You will then be provided an opportunity to  upload a profile picture and prompted to complete any profile fields that the  Site Administrator has set as mandatory.&nbsp;  The account activation link is valid for 24 hours only.&nbsp; After this time you will need to submit your registration  form again. </p>
<p>If you do not receive an email confirmation  message after registration, please ensure the registration message has not been  caught by your email junk filter.&nbsp; Please  contact the Site Administrator if you have any problems registering. </p>
<p>Once  registered on the site you will need to enter your username, password and  institution to log in and access your portfolio.</p>
