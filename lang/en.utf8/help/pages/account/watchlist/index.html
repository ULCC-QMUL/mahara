<h3><strong>My Watchlist</strong></h3>
<p>Your Watchlist displays a list of those Artefacts, Views and Communities  that you have access to, and have elected to monitor for changes and updates by  using the &lsquo;Add to Watchlist&rsquo; option when these items are on screen.</p>
<p>You can Stop Monitoring an item at any stage.&nbsp; In addition to all users, you can search on a  specific user&rsquo;s Artefacts, Views and/or Communities.</p>
<p>Items highlighted  with an asterisk&nbsp; &lsquo; * &rsquo; &nbsp;indicate that the child or any items belonging  to that View or Artefact are also being monitored.&nbsp; For example if you are monitoring a View, the  children would be any Artefacts within that View.&nbsp; If you are monitoring an Artefact, the  children would be any Artefact that is linked to that first top level Artefact (such  as a Blog and a Blog post or a Folder and a File).</p>
