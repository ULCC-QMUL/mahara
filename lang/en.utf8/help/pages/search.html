<h3><strong>Search</strong></h3>
<p>Search allows  you to find users, Communities and Views that you may access. You can enter a  specific search or you can search for all users or all Communities by launching  a search with an empty Query field, using the relevant dropdown option.</p>
<p>Unless you  are a Site Administrator or Staff member, users are search upon and listed by  their Preferred Name.</p>
<p>Clicking on  a user&rsquo;s Preferred Name will allow you to view any public profile information they  have submitted and provide links to any Views to which you have access.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can  also add this user to your Friends list if the request friendship box is  displayed.&nbsp; You may also invite them to  any Invite Only Communities you own if they are not yet a member.</p>
<p>Clicking on  a Community name will take you to the Communities main page and depending on  the membership option the Community owner has selected, allow you to join the  Community.</p>
<p>When accessing  another user&rsquo;s View, you will see the following options at the bottom of the View screen.</p>
<p><em>Place feedback</em><br>
  You can place Feedback on a user&rsquo;s View or an Artefact within that  View.&nbsp; You may make your Feedback Public  or Private.&nbsp; Public Feedback may be seen  by other users with access to the View.&nbsp;  Private Feedback will only be seen by the View owner.&nbsp; A View owner may choose to make your Public  Feedback Private, but cannot make your Private Feedback Public.</p>
<p>Staff members will be able to include a file with their Feedback where  the View has been submitted to them for assessment via a course based Community.</p>
<p><em>Report objectionable material</em><br>
  If you come across material within a View that you believe to be  offensive or inappropriate, you can report this to the Site Administrator using  the Objectionable material form.&nbsp; Please  consider the context in which this item is used before reporting Objectionable  Material.</p>
<p><em>Print</em><br>
  The Print option will allow you print a printer friendly version of the  View or Artefact you currently have open.</p>
<p><em>Add View to Watchlist </em><br>
