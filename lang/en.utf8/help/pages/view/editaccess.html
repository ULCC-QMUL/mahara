<h3>Edit View Acces</h3>
<p>Here you can control who sees your view, and when they can do so. By default, only you can see your views.</p>
<p>All dates are optional. If you wish, you can use them to restrict the time in which people can see your view.</p>
<p>If you add more than one rule which matches someone, only one of the rules has to match for the person to be allowed to access the view.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Nigel is in the group "The Coolpeople's Club". If you allow him to access your view today, and allow The Coolpeople's Club to access your view tomorrow, he will be able to access the view on both days.</p>
