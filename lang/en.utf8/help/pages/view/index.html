<h3><strong>My Views</strong></h3>
<p>A View is a collection of Artefacts from your ePortfolio, placed into a  pre-formatted template.&nbsp; As other people  can only see your Artefacts when displayed in a View, you can assign access to any  number of Groups, Communities and individuals as you wish.&nbsp; A View can also be kept private.</p>
<p>You may create as many different Views as you like and you can reuse your  Artefacts amongst all of your Views.</p>
<p>If you are preparing a View as part of an assessed task you can submit the&nbsp; View(s) to your tutor for assessment via a course-based  or Controlled Membership Community.&nbsp;  Submitting your View will lock the entire View and all associated  Artefacts from editing and provide a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; of your View on a certain  date.&nbsp; Any users with access to that View  will still be able to place Feedback and Comments while it is locked for  submission.</p>
<p>Once the assessment process has been completed your tutor will release your  View so that you may resume editing. You will be notified when your View has  been released from submission.</p>

<p>When accessing another user&rsquo;s View, you will see  the following options at the bottom of the View screen.</p>
<p><em>Place feedback</em><br>
  You can place feedback on a user&rsquo;s View or an Artefact within that  View.&nbsp; You can make feedback Public or  Private.&nbsp; Public Feedback may be seen by  other users with access to the View.&nbsp; Private  Feedback may only be read by the View owner.&nbsp;  A View owner may choose to make your Public feedback Private, but cannot  make your Private Feedback Public.</p>
<p>Staff members will be able to include a file with their Feedback where  the View has been submitted to them for assessment.</p>
<p><em>Report objectionable material</em><br>
  If you come across material within a View that you believe to be  offensive or inappropriate, you can report this to the Site Administrator using  the Objectionable material form.&nbsp; It is  important to consider the material within the context of the View.</p>
