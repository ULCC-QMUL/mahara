<h3>My Views</h3>
<p>A View is a collection of Artefacts from your ePortfolio, placed into a  pre-formatted template. As other people  can only see your Artefacts when displayed in a View, you can assign access to any  number of Communities and individuals as you wish. A View can also be kept private.</p>
<p>You may create as many different Views as you like and you can reuse your  Artefacts amongst all of your Views.</p>
<p>If you are preparing a View as part of an assessed task you can submit the View(s) to your tutor for assessment via a course-based  or Controlled Membership Community.  Submitting your View will lock the entire View and all associated  Artefacts from editing and provide a &#8216;snapshot&#8217; of your View on a certain  date. Any users with access to that View  will still be able to place Feedback and Comments while it is locked for  submission.</p>
<p>Once the assessment process has been completed your tutor will release your  View so that you may resume editing. You will be notified when your View has  been released from submission.</p>
