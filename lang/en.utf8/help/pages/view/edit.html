<h3><strong>Edit View</strong></h3>
<p>In Edit View you may add any of the Artefacts within your  portfolio to your View and arrange them as per the design template.</p>
<p>Depending on the template you have selected, a number of different display  options will be available.</p>
<p><strong><em>Display options:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Labels </strong>&ndash; Labels give you the option of  entering in a single line of text as a title or brief description within the  View.&nbsp; Ensure you press Enter after  entering text within a Label box to confirm your entry.</p>
<p><strong>Text Boxes&nbsp; - </strong>A Text Box allows you to enter multiple lines  of formatted text, using the HTML editor (unless disabled within your  Preferences).&nbsp; Ideal for more detailed  descriptions or short passages of text within your View.</p>
<p><strong>Artefact List</strong>&nbsp;  - A text based list of compatible Artefacts that you have associated&nbsp; with the View, with links to each Artefact.</p>
<p>An Artefact that is a &lsquo;container&rsquo; or parent of other Artefacts (such as  a blog which is a container for individual blog posts) can be listed itself or  you can choose to display a list of all it&rsquo;s associated Artefacts.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Size Embedded  Artefact</strong> - A Fixed  Size Embedded Artefact is a single Artefact embedded into the page where the  display size of the Artefact will be specified by the template.&nbsp; Only Artefacts (e.g. images) that are able to  be displayed in this size may be placed here.</p>
<p><strong>Resizable Embedded  Artefact - </strong>A<strong> </strong>Resizable Embedded Artefact is a  single Artefact embedded into the View where the size in which the Artefact is  displayed may be adjusted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Placing Artefacts within your View:</em></strong></p>
<p>All the Artefacts currently sitting in your ePortfolio are listed on the  right of the screen.&nbsp; They are listed by  Artefact type (Blog, Profile, File etc), then by Artefact container if  applicable (e.g. Blog, Folder), and then by individual Artefact.&nbsp; Use the + and &ndash; icons to expand/collapse this  tree directory structure.</p>
<p>Each page element box contains basic instructions on how it may be used  within the View.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To select an Artefact use the +/- icons on the directory listing and  single mouse click the desired Artefact.&nbsp;  A small triangle will appear against the Artefact to show it has been  selected.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once an Artefact has been selected all the display areas that will  support this type of Artefact will be highlighted.&nbsp; To place the Artefact within a box, click  inside the element box.</p>
<p>Depending on the display box and Artefact type you have selected, you  then may be given various display options which you can select by clicking on  its description.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List  item (lists links to the Artefact/s)</li>
  <li>List  children of this Artefact (list items within this Artefact)</li>
  <li>Display  entire Artefact</li>
  <li>Display  metadata for this Artefact</li>
</ul>
<p>Artefact metadata includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Artefact  Title </li>
  <li>Artefact  Type</li>
  <li>Owner</li>
  <li>Creation  date</li>
  <li>Last  modification date</li>
  <li>Description  (where entered)</li>
  <li>Artefact  size (the units will depend on the Artefact type)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where allowed, you can add additional Artefacts by selecting another  Artefact and clicking within the box.</p>
<p>You can remove Artefacts by selecting the [ X ] button listed against  its title or replace them by selecting and adding in another Artefact.</p>
<p>When entering text within a Label box, ensure you press Enter to confirm  your edit.</p>
<p>Note: Ensure any images that you have loaded into your file repository  are a suitable size for display.&nbsp; This is  usually around 300x300 pixels</p>
