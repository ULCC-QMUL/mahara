<h3><strong>My Friends</strong></h3>
<p>Your Friends area displays a list of those users who have been flagged  as your Friend within the site, and any of their Views to which you have been  assigned access.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Using the dropdown menu allows you to move between your existing Friends  list any Friendship Requests you have pending.</p>
<p>To add someone to your Friends list you will need to view their profile  &ndash; either via a View, Community or Search result.&nbsp; Depending on their Friendship Control  settings you may be automatically accepted as their Friend or you may need to send  a Friendship request.&nbsp; If you do not see  an Add to Friends option, the user most likely set their account preferences to  not allow new friends to be added to their list.</p>
<p>When sending a Friendship Request you can choose to send with the  request, a short message introducing yourself.&nbsp;  This is important to include when you have set yourself a Preferred  Name.</p>
<p>When you add someone to your Friends list by accepting their request, you  are automatically added to their list.&nbsp;  When you remove someone from your Friends list or decline a Friendship Request,  you are also removed from their list.&nbsp; If  you remove someone from your Friends list they will automatically be notified of  this change.</p>
<p>A user can resubmit their Friendship Request to you, even if you have  previously rejected it.</p>
<p>When accessing another user&rsquo;s View, you will see  the following options at the bottom of the View screen.</p>
<p><em>Place feedback</em><br>
  You can place Feedback on a user&rsquo;s View or an Artefact within that  View.&nbsp; You may make your Feedback Public or  Private.&nbsp; Public Feedback may be seen by  other users with access to the View.&nbsp; Private  Feedback will only be seen by the View owner.&nbsp;  A View owner may choose to make your Public Feedback Private, but cannot  make your Private Feedback Public.</p>
<p>Staff members will be able to include a file with their Feedback where  the View has been submitted to them for assessment via a course based Community.</p>
<p><em>Report objectionable material</em><br>
  If you come across material within a View that you believe to be  offensive or inappropriate, you can report this to the Site Administrator using  the Objectionable material form.&nbsp; Please  consider the context in which this item is used before reporting Objectionable  Material.</p>
<p><em>Print</em><br>
  The Print option will allow you print a printer friendly version of the View  or Artefact you currently have open.</p>
<p><em>Add View to Watchlist </em><br>
  Add View to Watchlist allows you to add this View to your Watchlist so  that you may receive notifications of any changes made.</p>
<p><em>Add entire View contents to  Watchlist </em><br>
  Add entire View contents to Watchlist allows you to add this View and  all Artefacts associated with it, to your Watchlist so that you may receive  notifications of any changes made.</p>
