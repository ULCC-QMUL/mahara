<h3><strong>My Owned Communities</strong></h3>
<p>Communities, like Groups, are a collection of users but they are created  at the site level rather than within an individual&rsquo;s ePortfolio.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Your Owned Communities area lists those Communities that you have created  and any Pending Membership Requests (depending on the which membership setting  you have selected).</p>
<p>For privacy reasons unless you are a Site Administrator or Staff user  you will only see a Community member&rsquo;s Preferred Name listed.</p>
<p>You can assign any Community you are a member or owner of, access rights  to any of your Views.&nbsp; When you assign a  Community access to a View, all members of that Community will also be given  access.</p>
<p>You can view your Community&rsquo;s main page by clicking on its name.&nbsp; Viewing the Community main page will allow  you to see a list of members of this Community, any Pending Membership Requests  and links to any Views that this Community has access to. &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Views and Members dropdown menus to generate  the required information and assign appropriate access rights.</p>
