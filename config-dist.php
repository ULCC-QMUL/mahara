// For each log level, you can specify where the messages are displayed.

// when debugging but not on a live site!
// LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG makes the error messages go to the log as specified
// by the apache ErrorLog directive. It's probably useful to have this on
// for all log levels.
// You can combine them with bitwise operations,
// e.g. LOG_TARGET_SCREEN | LOG_TARGET_ERRORLOG
//
// This configuration is suitable for people running Mahara for the first
// time. You will immediately see environment errors, and so can correct
// them. You will be able to see other debugging information in your error
// logs. Once your site is up and running you might want to remove the
// environment level logging completely, and just log everything else to
// the error log.
