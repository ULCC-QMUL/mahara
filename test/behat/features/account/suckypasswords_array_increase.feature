 Feature: Suckypasswords Test increase of array size
  In order to limit the crappy passwords people try to put in
  As an admin
  So I can make sure that my users/myself have decent passwords

     | username | password | email | firstname | lastname | institution | authname | role |

  And I fill in "New password" with "abc123"
  And I fill in "Confirm password" with "abc123"
  And I press "Save"
  And I should see "Your password is too easy"
