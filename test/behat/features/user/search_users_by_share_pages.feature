Feature: Searching by user in Shared Pages
    In order to search by name on the shared with me page
    As an admin I need to create users
    So I can search for them by name

Background:
     Given the following "users" exist:
      | username  | password  | email | firstname | lastname  | institution   | authname  |role   |
      | bob   | mahara1   | bob@example.com   | Bob   | Bobby | mahara    | internal  | member    |
      | jen   | mahara1   | jen@example.com   | Jen   | Jenny | mahara    | internal  | member    |
