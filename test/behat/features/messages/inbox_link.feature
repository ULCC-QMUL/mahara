Scenario: Clicking on the Inbox link on the right menu (Bug 1427019)
   # Log in as users
   Given I log in as "userA" with password "Kupuhipa1"
   # Navigating to the Inbox via the 'more' link in the Inbox block
   And I follow "More"
   # Verifying that you do not see a page full of error messages
   And I should not see "Call stack"
   And I should see "Notifications"
   And I should see "Compose"
