Feature: Editing a group as an admin
In order to edit a group
As an admin
So I can make changes to the group settings

Background:

Given the following "users" exist:
     | username | password | email | firstname | lastname | institution | authname | role |
     | userA | Kupuhipa1 | test01@example.com | Pete | Mc | mahara | internal | member |


Scenario: Uploading groups via CSV and editing as an admin (Bug 1420590)
 Given I log in as "admin" with password "Kupuhipa1"
 And I follow "Administration"
 And I choose "Add groups by CSV" in "Groups (Administer groups)"
 # Attaching the groups via CSV
 And I attach the file "groups.csv" to "CSV file"
 When I press "Add groups by CSV"
 And I should see "Your CSV file was processed successfully."
 And I choose "Update group members by CSV" in "Groups (Administer groups)"
 # Verify the warnings there
 And I should see "Every CSV file upload removes all existing group members, including group administrators, completely. Ensure that you have at least one administrator for each group in your CSV file."
 # Attaching the group members via CSV
 And I attach the file "groupmembers.csv" to "CSV file"
 And I press "Update group members by CSV"

 | Group name | Group awesome sauce |
