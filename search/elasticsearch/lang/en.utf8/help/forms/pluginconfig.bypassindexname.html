<h3>Bypass index name</h3>

<p>Most of the time, this setting should be left blank.</p>
<p>If this setting is populated, then Mahara will load new index data into the elasticsearch
index of this name, while still retrieving search results from the elasticsearch index stored under the "Index
Name" field.</p>
<p>If you want to reindex the whole site in a new index, but don't want to bring your current search capability down until
reindexing finishes, then you can use this field to point the reindexing cron at a new index, while the search functionality continues
to use the old index.</p>
<p>Once the queue is empty, copy this index's name into the Index Name field.</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed from the web interface. You may change it by adding
a line to your config.php setting the value of
<code>$cfg->plugin->search->elasticsearch->analyzer</code>.</p>
