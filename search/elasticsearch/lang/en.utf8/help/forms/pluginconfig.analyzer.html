<href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/analysis/custom-analyzer/">http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/analysis/custom-analyzer/</a>
<p>This setting cannot be changed from the web interface. You may change it by adding
a line to your config.php setting the value of
<code>$cfg->plugin->search->elasticsearch->analyzer</code>.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you don't change from the default "mahara_analyzer"
unless you know what you are doing</p>
