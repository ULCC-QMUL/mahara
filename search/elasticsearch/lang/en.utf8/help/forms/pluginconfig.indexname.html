<h3>Index name</h3>

<p>This is the name of the elasticsearch index that will be used by the search 
functionality of the site. It is unlikely you will need to change this from its
default value, unless you are using the same elasticsearch cluster as an index
for multiple Mahara sites; or if you have done a reindex using the "Bypass index"
setting.</p>
<p>If you change this to a new value, you may need to use the "reset ALL indexes"
button to trigger the creation of the new index.</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed from the web interface. You may change it by adding
a line to your config.php setting the value of
<code>$cfg->plugin->search->elasticsearch->indexname</code>.</p>
