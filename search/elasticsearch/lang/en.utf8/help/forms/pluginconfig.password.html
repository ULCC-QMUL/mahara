<h3>Auth password</h3>

<p>If your Elasticsearch server requires an HTTP basic auth username and password to access it, you may provide the <strong>password</strong> here. <strong>Note:</strong> The core Elasticsearch software itself does not provide username or password features, but you may achieve this functionality by using a plugin or by accessing it through a proxy.</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed through the web interface. You may change it by setting a value in your config.php file for the following config variable:</p>
<p><code>$cfg->plugin->search->elasticsearch->password</code>.</p>
