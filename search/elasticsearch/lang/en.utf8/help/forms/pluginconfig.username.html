<h3>Auth password</h3>

<p>If your elasticsearch server requires an HTTP basic auth username and password to access
it, you may provide the <strong>username</strong> here. (The core elasticsearch software
itself provides no username or password features, but you may achieve this functionality
by a plugin, or by accessing it through a proxy.)</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed from the web interface. You may change it by adding
a line to your config.php setting the value of
<code>$cfg->plugin->search->elasticsearch->username</code>.</p>
