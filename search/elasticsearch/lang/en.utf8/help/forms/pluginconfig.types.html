<h3>Elasticsearch Search Type</h3>

<p>A comma-separated list of the elements to index. Each of these must match
an ElasticsearchType subclass under search/elasticsearch/type.</p>
<p>You shouldn't need to change this unless you've implemented a new search type, or want
to disable a particular search type.</p>
<p>This setting cannot be changed from the web interface. You may change it by adding
a line to your config.php setting the value of
<code>$cfg->plugin->search->elasticsearch->types</code>.</p>
